# Tailscale for Fire OS 5 (Fire TV Stick 2nd gen)

Unofficial, reproducible build of the **Tailscale Android client** for **Fire OS 5 /
Android 5.1 (API 22)** devices with **OpenGL ES 2.0** GPUs — hardware the official app
cannot support.

Current stable **Tailscale 1.98.8**, patched to run at API 22, **routing traffic through an
exit node**.
