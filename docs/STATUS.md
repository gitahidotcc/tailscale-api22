# Status — WORKING

Last updated 2026-09-27.

Tailscale **1.98.8** runs on **Fire OS 5 / Android 5.1 / API 22** with eight patches,
**routes traffic through an exit node**, and starts the VPN after reboot.

---

## Verified end-to-end

On a Fire TV Stick 2nd gen (`AFTT`, Fire OS 5.2.9.5, Mali-450 / GLES 2.0):

| | |
|---|---|
| Builds at `MIN_SDK=22` | ✅ `gomobile bind -androidapi 22` included |
| Installs on API 22 | ✅ versionCode 468, targetSdk 35 |
| Compose UI on GLES 2.0 | ✅ |
| Login | ✅ persists across restarts |
| Tunnel | ✅ `tun0`, `100.64.0.10` |
| DERP relay | ✅ `derp-16 (mia)`, ~72 ms |
| Online to control plane | ✅ no "offline" marker |
| Health warnings | ✅ clear |
| Peer list | ✅ `Peers=6`, grouped by user |
| **Exit node** | ✅ **`exit-node-host.othernet.ts.net`** |
| **Traffic through exit node** | ✅ **1 MB download → 1,113,884 bytes over `tun0`** |
| Survives reboot | ✅ `BOOT_COMPLETED` starts the saved VPN profile |

> [!TIP]
> **Measuring exit-node routing:** public egress IP is an unreliable check — if the exit
> node sits behind the same internet connection, both ends report the same address. Use the
> tunnel byte counters instead. Without an exit node selected, public-internet traffic never
> traverses `tun0` at all.
>
> ```sh
> adb shell cat /sys/class/net/tun0/statistics/rx_bytes
> adb shell curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{size_download}\n' http://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip
> adb shell cat /sys/class/net/tun0/statistics/rx_bytes
> ```

## Reboot behaviour

Upstream relies on Android's **always-on VPN**, which is API 24+ and unavailable on API 22.
Patch `0008` adds a `BOOT_COMPLETED` action to the existing `IPNReceiver` and grants
`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`. It reuses `StartVPNWorker`, so startup still requires a saved,
ready profile and previously granted `VpnService` permission; it does not bypass Android
consent or store another credential.

Verified on a ZK-R31A station running Android 5.1.1/API 22: 38 seconds after a cold boot,
`com.tailscale.ipn` was running, `IPNService` was a sticky foreground service, `tun0` owned
`100.109.154.78/32`, and four tailnet pings completed with 0% packet loss. The Tailscale UI
did not need to be opened.

> [!NOTE]
> The station's Android 5 `adbd` accepts only one active transport. If the workstation is
> already attached to `<LAN-IP>:5555`, a second connection to the Tailscale IP can remain
> `offline`. Disconnect the LAN transport first, then connect through Tailscale:
>
> ```sh
> adb disconnect 192.168.8.13:5555
> adb connect 100.109.154.78:5555
> ```
>
> Verified after the autostart reboot: Tailscale ADB reported `device` and executed shell
> commands normally.

## Build

```sh
TS_REF=1.98.8-t1241b225b-gbcbaf1889 MIN_SDK=22 ./scripts/build.sh
```

~12 s incremental, a few minutes cold. Patches apply automatically; the build hard-fails
if any does not.

## The eight patches

| # | Fixes | API |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | `NotificationChannel`, unguarded in `App.onCreate()` | 26 |
| 0002 | `QuickToggleService : TileService`, 2 call sites | 24 |
| 0003 | `getForegroundService` / `startForegroundService`, 2 sites | 26 |
| 0004 | `Network.bindSocket` → `VpnService.protect(fd)` | 23 |
| 0005 | netmap decode: `decodeFromString`, not `decodeFromStream` | ≤23 |
| 0006 | drop `setExpedited` from `IPNReceiver` work requests | 31 |
| 0007 | `coreLibraryDesugaring` for `java.time` | 26 |
| 0008 | start the saved VPN profile on `BOOT_COMPLETED` | 22 |

Upstream runs at minSdk 26, so guards that became dead code were dropped over time. All of
these are that, **except 0005** — not a missing guard, but a platform bug Google fixed at
API 24.

### 0005 is the interesting one

```
IllegalArgumentException: Bad position (limit 16261): -118
```

A defect in Android's own `CharsetDecoderICU`, which `decodeFromStream` reaches through —
not a Tailscale bug. `CharsetReader.doRead()` hands the decoder a `CharBuffer` built with
`CharBuffer.wrap(...).slice()`, so its `arrayOffset()` is non-zero. On API ≤ 23,
`CharsetDecoderICU.setPosition()` computes `position + outputOffset - arrayOffset()`, lands
on a negative value, and `Buffer.position()` rejects it. Fixed in Android at API 24;
`decodeFromString` is the workaround below that
([kotlinx.serialization#2457](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/issues/2457)).

The slice only appears on the second trip through the decode loop, so the payload has to
exceed the 16 KB internal buffer. **Size alone is the trigger** — the content does not
matter, and the offsets in the message vary between runs. Only the netmap notification is
that large (28 KB here); State and Prefs are small and always decoded fine, so **peers
silently never arrived while everything else worked**. The exception escaped the Go
callback and the entire notification was dropped, with no error anywhere.

Upstream never meets this — it ships minSdk 26, above the API 24 fix. kotlinx.serialization
became exposed only in 1.5.0, when `CharsetReader` was added as an optimization; Tailscale
pins 1.6.3.

### 0004 — the connectivity fix

`bindSocketToNetwork()` failed two ways on API 22: the `NetworkRequest` callback never
fires (`cachedDefaultNetwork` permanently null), and `Network.bindSocket(FileDescriptor)`
is API 23 regardless — a `NoSuchMethodError`, which the surrounding `catch (Exception)`
would not have caught. Fixed with `VpnService.protect(fd)` (API 14), the platform's own
mechanism for keeping a VPN app's sockets outside its tunnel. Upstream never needs it
because `bindSocket` is strictly better at API 23+.

## Setting an exit node

The UI picker works. To do it from a shell:

```sh
adb shell am broadcast -a com.tailscale.ipn.USE_EXIT_NODE \
  -n com.tailscale.ipn/.IPNReceiver \
  --es exitNode 'exit-node-host.othernet.ts.net' --ez allowLanAccess true
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The name must match `displayName` (`ComputedName ?: Name`) **exactly** — for a shared
> node that is the full FQDN, not the short hostname. A mismatch fails silently apart from
> a notification.

Routes only take effect once the tunnel is re-established, so reconnect afterwards:

```sh
adb shell am broadcast -a com.tailscale.ipn.DISCONNECT_VPN -n com.tailscale.ipn/.IPNReceiver
adb shell am broadcast -a com.tailscale.ipn.CONNECT_VPN    -n com.tailscale.ipn/.IPNReceiver
```

Confirm with `ip route show table <vpn table>` — expect ~46 `tun0` routes splitting
`0.0.0.0/0` (`0.0.0.0/5`, `8.0.0.0/7`, `32.0.0.0/3`, `64.0.0.0/2`, …) with the local LAN
carved out when `allowLanAccess=true`. The table number changes between installs; find it
via `ip rule`.

## Signing

Releases are signed with a durable key so published APKs form a coherent upgrade chain.
Gradle's default debug key is generated per-machine, so without this two people building
the same commit produce APKs that cannot upgrade over one another.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/sign-apk.sh          # signs the newest APK in dist/, refreshes the .sha256
```

Signer: `CN=tailscale-firetv-fireos5`, SHA-256 `b6e56d68…53b5`.

The signing key is **deliberately not in this repo.** A public repo would expose the
encrypted blob to indefinite offline attack, and a signing key is a one-way door — once
published it can never be un-published.

It lives in two places instead:

| Where | Purpose |
|---|---|
| GitHub repo secrets — `TS_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `TS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `TS_KEY_ALIAS` | CI signing |
| `~/.keystores/tailscale-firetv-release.{jks,pass}` (mode 0600) + password manager | the recoverable backup |

`sign-apk.sh` resolves the keystore as `TS_KEYSTORE_BASE64` → local `.jks`, and the
passphrase as `TS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` → macOS Keychain (`tailscale-firetv-release`/`firetv`)
→ password file → prompt. The same script works locally and in CI.

> [!CAUTION]
> **GitHub secrets are write-only.** They cannot be read back. **The local keystore is the
> only recoverable copy** — back it up to a password manager. Losing it means every future
> release breaks in-place upgrades and the signing identity has to be rotated.

Store the passphrase on a new machine with:

```sh
security add-generic-password -U -s tailscale-firetv-release -a firetv -w
```

We re-sign the debug-built APK rather than building the `release` variant, because that
variant enables `minifyEnabled` + `shrinkResources`, and ProGuard is a genuine risk to
kotlinx.serialization and the gomobile JNI bindings. Re-signing ships the exact bytes we
tested. The APK therefore stays **debuggable**, which is also what makes `run-as` log
reading possible.

## Reading the Go-side logs

Tailscale's Go logs never reach logcat. The APK is a **debug** build
(`android:debuggable=true`), so:

```sh
adb shell run-as com.tailscale.ipn cat files/ipn.log..log1.txt
```

JSON-per-line logtail records; they rotate fast, so pull promptly. This is the only way to
see netmap, DERP, `wgcfg` and socket-binding activity. Kotlin crashes still go to logcat.

## Gotcha: poison-pill work items

A failed `USE_EXIT_NODE` broadcast (pre-0006) persists a WorkManager job that crashes the
app on **every** start. Clear it without losing the login:

```sh
adb shell run-as com.tailscale.ipn rm -f databases/androidx.work.workdb*
```

`files/profile-data` holds the login and is untouched.

## Device under test

Fire TV Stick 2nd gen — `AFTT` / `tank`, retail **LY73PR**, Fire OS 5.2.9.5, Android 5.1.1
(API 22), armeabi-v7a, Mali-450 (GLES 2.0), 1920x1080 @ 320 dpi, 895 MB RAM.

## Possible follow-ups

Everything needed works. Optional polish:

1. `NetworkChangeCallback` never fires on API 22, so `protect()` pins to nothing. Equivalent
   on a single-uplink device; would matter on multi-uplink.
2. Launch is slow, 5-7 s to first frame, on this hardware.
